    "# Which Kinds of Players Contribute the Most Data?  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video game servers create detailed records of player activity, offering researchers valuable insight into how players interact with digital worlds. At UBC, data from a Minecraft server is being used to study player engagement and improve server management. A key challenge is identifying which types of players contribute the most data, so that recruitment and server resources can be optimized.  \n",
    "In this project, we use clustering analysis to answer: **Which kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?**\n",

    "## Methods & Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering:**  \n",
    "- Imported data and calculated session duration (`session_length`) for each session.\n",
    "- Summarized, for each player: total sessions, total playtime, average session length.\n",
    "- Merged player demographic info with session activity using `hashedEmail` as the unique key.\n",
    "- Selected numeric features (`total_sessions`, `total_playtime`, `avg_session_length`) and standardized them for clustering.\n",
    "- Removed missing values before clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis:**  \n",
    "- Most players have low total sessions and playtime, but a small number of players are extremely active.\n",
    "- Some variables are highly skewed, so log transformation was used for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering Analysis:**  \n",
    "- Used k-means clustering on standardized features to segment players into groups by activity level.\n",
    "- The elbow plot (Figure 2) shows the best number of clusters is k = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- **Cluster 1:** Largest group (117 players), lowest average session activity.\n",
    "- **Cluster 2:** Small group (4 players), high variability and the highest average playtime and session length.\n",
    "- **Cluster 3:** Also small (4 players), with high average sessions and playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1. Player Activity Clusters (scatterplot):**  \n",
    "> The scatterplot shows clear separation of clusters by activity level. Cluster 1 is tightly grouped near the origin (casual/infrequent players), Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 contain the highly active users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 2. Elbow Plot for Player Activity Clustering:**  \n",
    "> The \"elbow\" at k = 3 supports the choice of three clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 3. Log-Transformed Histograms by Cluster:**  \n",
    "> The histograms show that most players (Cluster 1) have very low session activity. Cluster 2 contains a small number of highly variable, highly active players. Cluster 3 also contains only a few players but with consistently high total sessions and playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results & Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After k-means clustering on player activity metrics, three distinct groups emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cluster 1:** Casual/infrequent users, low total sessions, playtime, and short sessions.\n",
    "- **Cluster 2:** Very small group of \"super users\" with extremely high total playtime and session length, and highly variable behavior.\n",
    "- **Cluster 3:** Another small group with consistently high total sessions and playtime, but lower variability than Cluster 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 are the main contributors of data to the server, even though they are small in number. Cluster 1, the majority, contributes relatively little.  \n",
    "**This suggests that most data comes from a few highly engaged players.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**  \n",
    "- Some values (e.g., negative playtime/session length) indicate data quality issues.\n",
    "- K-means assumes clusters are spherical and similar size; with skewed data and small clusters, results may be sensitive to scaling and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**  \n",
    "- Recruitment and engagement strategies should focus on understanding and retaining Cluster 2 and 3 users.\n",
    "- Future work could include deeper analysis of demographics (e.g., experience level, age) and investigation of data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering analysis revealed that the majority of useful data is generated by a very small group of highly active players. Targeted engagement of these users is crucial for data-driven research and server management. Efforts to increase overall data contribution should consider both retaining top contributors and motivating casual players.\n",
